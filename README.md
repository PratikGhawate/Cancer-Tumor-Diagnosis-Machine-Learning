# Cancer Tumor Diagnosis with Machine Learning 🩺📊

## Introduction 📝

Machine learning is a powerful concept and tool that can be applied to numerous real-world applications. This project leverages machine learning to work with cancer data to diagnose whether a specific tumor is benign or malignant.

...

## Data & Variables 📊

### Data Source
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle.com and is titled "Cancer Data, Benign and Malignant Cancer Data." It comprises observations on 570 different tumors, with 30 independent quantitative variables describing the tumor and one qualitative response variable indicating the diagnosis as benign or malignant.

## Conclusion 🏁

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the power of machine learning in diagnosing breast cancer tumors. The Random Forest model emerged as the best-performing model, offering high accuracy and predictive power. It identified four crucial variables for tumor classification.

By focusing on these attributes, cancer researchers can gain valuable insights into tumor behavior, potentially leading to improved cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies.
